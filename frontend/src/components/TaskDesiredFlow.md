* User creates a new task
* Dual generation kicks off
* The user selects one of the options or comments on it.
* If the user comments then we immediatly kick off a subsequent dual generation (as a subsequent message to the users message)
* If the user selects one of the messages then we wait for the tool response from the server before kicking off another dual generation
